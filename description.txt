# Automated-Attendance-System-using-Surveillance-Camera
Objective: To identify faces that gets detected in surveillance camera and stores it in the database for analytics.
	                                  Online Attendance marking through surveillance camera:
Initially each student has to register the face with the student name and register number. 
Each student will be assigned with unique person id and it will get stored in the database. 
Using cognitive face API each student face is trained with the API and get stored in the Microsoft cloud and database will be created and which gets automatically updated with registered student’s name and register number. 
We can access this project through surveillance camera through the camera’s ip. 
The video streamed live inside the classroom is processed and that recognizes the students face through deep learning algorithm. 
If the recognized face and trained face matches then attendance will be marked in the excel sheet in the respective student’s record on that particular date. 
This saves so much of time as well as it prevents proxy and also it restricts from managing the large amount of data and records.
